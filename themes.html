					<li data-theme="b">The problems with capitalism	</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Well's novel seems to be his suggestion of what a capitalistic society could bring in the future with the way it often takes advantage of the working class to benefit the wealthy</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The working class in the novel has been so suppressed that they have been pushed underground, and been treated so badly that they have become a brutal species</li>
					<li data-theme="d">While the business class has relied so long on the working class, that they've become a very dependent and frail species of humans</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The working class, or morlocks, have even come to hunting the business class in the story, perhaps a sign of their class awareness</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Wells also suggests that the industrial revolution of the 1800's has furthered the gap between the classes and could lead to a society similar to what is seen in the book</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Social Darwinism</li>
					<li data-theme="d">This novel is a prime example of social Darwinism, as the humans have evolved into much different creatures then they were at the time the novel was written due to their social conditions</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However in a sense it is contradictory of the main point of social Darwinism, as social Darwinism suggests that species will evolve to eventually become the perfect species</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It is seen in the novel that the morlocks and eloi have evolved quite a bit due to their social situations, however it is not necessarily for the best, as the morlocks are somewhat evil creatures that live underground and the eloi are weak and dependent creatures</li>
