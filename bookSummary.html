					can send him forward in time. The narrator of the story meets the time traveler and learns his stories of the future. 
					The time traveler takes his machine over 800,000 years into the future when he finally decides to stop and explore his surroundings. 
					In the future he discovers a society in which the working class has been forced underground and lives an atrocious lifestyle, 
					while the business class has become a very afraid and feeble species that is very dependent on the working class or morlocks. 
					The time traveler loses his machine during his exploration, and must go through tough measures to find it and continue on in his travel. 
					During in his experiences he befriends an Eloi woman, the business class, Weena. He travels along with her in his 
					experiences yet ultimately they get separated in his quest to find his machine. Once he finds his machine he takes 
					it further into the future, seemingly all the way to the end of humankind, and the earth. He then returns to the present
					day and tells of his story.</li>
