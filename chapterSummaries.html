					<li data-theme="d">The story begins in the Time Traveller's home as he speaks to a group of men, including the narrator</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He tells of the fourth dimension and uses the example of how a cube exists in time AND space, as time is the fourth dimension</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The men are not sure whether to believe him, as he goes even further saying that we should be able to speed up, slow down, or even go backwards in the fourth dimension, just as we can in the other three</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He then builds a small time machine out of ivory and crystal, its about the size of a clock</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He has a guest send the machine forward in time with a lever, and it disappears, amazing the men</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He then shows them a larger machine in which he plans to explore time</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The narrator tells that not many of the men believed the Time Traveller as he is very intelligent and often played pranks of elaborate proportions</li>
					<li data-theme="c">A week later the narrator returns to the Time Traveller's home for another dinner, this time with some fewer guests of the previous week, and some new guests</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The Time Traveller has not appeared yet to the guests but when he does he is dusty and disheveled</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He washes up and the narrator suggests that he has perhaps traveled through time, however many men do not believe him and when the Traveller returns to tell his story many men object as they don't believe he could travel through time</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He tells them they must not interrupt him and they agree all listening with there attention growing as the story begins</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapters 3-4</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The Traveller tells how he went to his machine and slightly pushed the lever forward, after feeling a dizzying sensation, he emerges seeing that the clock in his lab has advanced 5 hours</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He then decides to push the machine a bit more, traveling faster and faster through time, his surroundings change and he fears he might eventually travel to a time where the machine is impeded by an object so he quickly stops it and is thrown through the air</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He has stepped out into a hail storm that shortly subsides, he then notices a giant statue of a white sphinx on a large bronze pedestal</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Fearful that the future has evolved into an age of cruel and savage man, he slowly peers around</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He notices many large buildings, and as he turns his machine right-side up he is noticed by figures dressed in rich robes by a near building</li>
					<li data-theme="c">A creature approaches him, appearing very beautiful, yet frail as if it were suffering from tuberculosis</li>
					<li data-theme="d">More creatures approach him surrounding him and speaking in a very smooth and sweet accent, he takes out the control device from his machine so as it won't be used by anyone else</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He describes the creatures as having larger than normal eyes, curly hair, and very thin red lips, he then points up to the sky trying to explain how he came there</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The creatures do not seem to understand him and he thinks that perhaps they are not as bright as he imagined people from the future to be</li>
					<li data-theme="c">They then take the Traveller to a large building covered in hieroglyphics, they also feed him strange fruit, and try to teach him a few words</li>

					<li data-theme="c">He explains that there is no gender distinction, and that old people seem to not exist, that it seems to be a communist paradise, and all hardship and fear has been eliminated</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He thinks that perhaps over centuries the effort to make life simpler has made it so simple that there is no danger, hard ship, or need for families</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He then states that his initial beliefs were all wrong</li>

				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapter 5</li>
					<li data-theme="d">As night falls he heads back to his machine, however he is surprised to find it missing</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It has been disabled so it couldn't have been moved in time, and the people seemed to frail to move it, which causes him to panic as he has no idea where it is</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He runs around the sphinx searching for it but only ends up startling a white creature, he then runs inside the building demanding his time machine, startling the creatures</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He eventually calms down and tries to deduce what could have happened</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He believes it couldn't have been moved very far, and that perhaps it is hidden in the base of the sphinx</li>
					<li data-theme="c">After failing to open the base and upsetting the creatures in the process he decides to be patient and take time to get to know the area</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He notices strange wells all over the place that seem to be sucking in air, he also changes his mind about the civilization being decadent and automated

					<li data-theme="d">The animal flees and he fails to track it down</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He later deduces that the new creature must live underground, and that perhaps the wells are there to supply a whole race of underground creatures, perhaps the laborers of the creatures above ground</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He later learns that his belief is correct and that underground creatures called "Morlocks" live and the creatures on the surface are called "Eloi"</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He asks Weena more questions about the Morlocks, but causes her to become upset</li>
